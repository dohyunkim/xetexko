XeTeX-ko Package version 4.1 (2022/03/18)
=========================================

XeTeX-ko is a macro package for Xe(La)TeX which supports typesetting
Korean documents including Old Hangul texts. Though XeTeX itself
already has basic facility to typeset Korean texts, this package
provides some enhanced features for quality products adapted to
Korean culture.

This package requires cjk-ko package for its full functionality.

Loading
-------
If you are a LaTeX user, declaring

    \usepackage{xetexko}
or

    \usepackage{kotex}
is sufficient to load the package. Notice that kotex.sty is a file
provided by cjk-ko package.

Under plain TeX:

    \input xetexko.sty


Package Options
---------------

    [hangul]
Load Hangul captions. Besides, this option also adjusts interline
spacing.

    [hanja]
Load Hanja captions. Also adjusts spacing as [hangul] option does.

Note that [unfonts] option is removed starting with v2.10, and so
Un TrueType will be used when no Hangul/Hanja font is declared.


Hangul Font Commands
--------------------

    \setmainhangulfont
    \setsanshangulfont
    \setmonohangulfont
Same as \setmainfont etc. provided by fontspec package, except that
these affect only Hangul characters and related symbols.

    \setmainhanjafont
    \setsanshanjafont
    \setmonohanjafont
Same as \setmainfont etc. except that these affect only Hanja
characters.

In like manner, these commands are available as well:

    \hangulfontspec       \hanjafontspec
    \newhangulfontfamily  \newhanjafontfamily
    \addhangulfontfeature \addhanjafontfeature

If \fallbackhanjafont is defined, it is used as a final fallback font.


Hangul Font Options
-------------------

    [InterLatinCJK=<dimen>]
Set spacing between Hangul/Hanja and Latin characters.

    [InterHangul=<dimen>]
Set spacing between Hangul characters.

    [CharRaise=<dimen>]
Raise the baseline of Hangul/Hanja characters.


Other User Commands
-------------------

    \dotemph{...}
Emphasise Hangul or Hanja by putting dot above.

    \begin{vertical}{<dimen>}
    \end{vertical}
This environment makes a vbox vertically typeset. <dimen> is an
argument to indicate the box height. When <dimen> is \empty, an hbox
with natural height will be made. For vertical typesetting of
entire document, use the command \verticaltypesetting instead.

    \은 \는 \이 \가 \을 \를 \와 \과 \로 \으로 \라 \이라
Commands for automatic Josa selection. Unlike those of cjk-ko
package, these commands work correctly even after Hangul or Hanja.
