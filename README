XeTeX-ko Package version 2.2 (2013/11/20)
=========================================

XeTeX-ko is a macro package for Xe(La)TeX which supports typesetting
Korean documents including Old Hangul texts. Though XeTeX itself
already has basic facility to typeset Korean texts, it is necessary
to provide some enhanced features for quality products adapted to
Korean culture. Therefore, this package has enabled, to say a few
among others, typesetting different character classes by different
fonts, insertion of small spaces between Hangul characters, and
raising or lowering latin punctuations after Hangul or Hanja.

This package requires cjk-ko package for Hangul counters and captions.

Loading
-------
If you are a LaTeX user, declaring

    \usepackage{xetexko}
or

    \usepackage{kotex}
is sufficient to load the package, which will load fontspec package
as well. Notice that kotex.sty is a file provided by cjk-ko package.

Under plain TeX:

    \input xetexko.sty


Package Options
---------------

    [hangul]
Load Hangul captions. Besides, this option also adjusts interword
and interline spacing.

    [hanja]
Load Hanja captions. Also adjusts spacing as [hangul] option does.

    [unfonts]
Load font setting predefined for Un TrueType fonts available at
http://kldp.net/projects/unfonts/.


Hangul Font Commands
--------------------

    \setmainhangulfont
    \setsanshangulfont
    \setmonohangulfont
Same as \setmainfont et. al. provided by fontspec package, except that
these affect only Hangul characters and related symbols.

    \setmainhanjafont
    \setsanshanjafont
    \setmonohanjafont
Same as \setmainfont et. al., except that these affect only Hanja
characters.

In like manner, these commands are available as well:

    \hangulfontspec
    \hanjafontspec
    \newhangulfontfamily
    \newhanjafontfamily
    \addhangulfontfeature
    \addhanjafontfeature

If \fallbackhanjafont is defined, it is used as a final fallback font.


Hangul Font Options
-------------------

    [hu=<dimen>]
Set spacing between Hangul and Latin characters.

    [interhchar=<dimen>]
Set spacing between Hangul characters.

    [lowerperiod=<dimen>]
Lower latin fullstop after Hangul character.

    [quoteraise=<dimen>]
Raise latin quotation marks.

    [postmathskip=<dimen>]

See xetexko-doc.pdf for more options.


Other User Commands
-------------------

    \dotemph{...}
Emphasise Hangul or Hanja by putting dot above.

    \begin{vertical}{<dimen>}
    \end{vertical}
This environment makes a vbox vertically typeset. <dimen> is an
argument required to indicate the box height. For vertical typesetting
of entire document, use the command \verticaltypesetting instead.

    \은 \는 \이 \가 \을 \를 \와 \과 \로 \으로 \라 \이라
